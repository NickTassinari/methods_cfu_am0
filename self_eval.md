# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am most proud of my ability to think through a problem in a way that is both curious and adapative. I like to approach 
these like a game where I have to find the answer and I am also willing to tinker around and see what else I can find in the code
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods allow you to alter and adapt your code to fit your liking or duty
